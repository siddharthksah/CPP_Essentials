## Projects
OCR with Tesseract
This project demonstrates how to use Tesseract, an optical character recognition (OCR) engine, to extract text from an image. The project includes a C++ program that reads in an image, processes it to extract text regions, and applies OCR using Tesseract to recognize the text.

### Lane Detection from Video Stream
This project demonstrates how to perform lane detection on a video stream using the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The project includes a C++ program that reads in frames from a video file, applies a perspective transform to obtain a top-down view, applies Canny edge detection and the LSD algorithm to detect lane markings, and draws the detected lanes on the original image.

### Face Detection in an Image
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to detect faces in an image using the Haar cascade classifier. The project includes a C++ program that reads in an image, applies the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces, and draws rectangles around the detected faces.

### Face Detection through Webcam
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to detect faces through a webcam using the Haar cascade classifier. The project includes a C++ program that captures frames from the webcam, applies the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces, and draws rectangles around the detected faces.

### Face Recognition using Eigenfaces
This project demonstrates how to use Eigenfaces, a popular algorithm for face recognition, to recognize faces from an image. The project includes a C++ program that reads in a set of training images, computes the eigenfaces, and applies them to recognize faces in a test image.

### Image Segmentation using K-means Clustering
This project demonstrates how to perform image segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The project includes a C++ program that reads in an image, applies K-means clustering to group pixels with similar colors, and outputs a segmented image.

### Object Tracking using Meanshift
This project demonstrates how to use meanshift, a popular algorithm for object tracking, to track an object in a video stream. The project includes a C++ program that reads in frames from a video file, initializes a region of interest around the object to be tracked, applies meanshift to track the object, and draws a rectangle around the tracked object.

### Sentiment Analysis using NLTK
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on a text using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The project includes a C++ program that tokenizes a sentence, calculates the sentiment score based on a list of positive and negative words, and outputs whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

### Basic Image Processing Algorithms in C++
This project demonstrates how to implement basic image processing algorithms in C++, including image inversion, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and thresholding. The project includes a set of C++ functions that can be used to process images in various ways.
